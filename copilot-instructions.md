# GOALS
As a DevOps, I must have a deep knowledge of the Clusters, Kubernetes, Docker, Cloud providers, Virtualization, CI tools, CD tools, and Observability tools.

# GETTING DATA
Use the "instructions" directory to store: instructions, prompt files, tool sets, modes, and documentation.
Create the prompt, instructions, and all files in JSON format.
Examine and store all commits from the repository https://github.com/gmedeirosnet/CI.CD.git

# OBJECTIVES
The objective is to create a LAB environment for learning DevOps CI/CD deployment tools through hands-on practice.

# DOCUMENTATION
Documentation should only be created in the docs/ directory
The study plan is in docs/StudyPlan.md
The Study reference is in https://notebooklm.google.com/notebook/04068cbd-0312-45b1-b221-ec2642e79464

# DIRECTORY STRUCTURE
- `instructions/` - JSON configuration files (instructions, prompts, tools, modes, documentation)
- `docs/` - Comprehensive documentation for each tool
- `scripts/` - Setup and utility scripts
- `src/` - Demo Spring Boot application
- `helm-charts/` - Kubernetes Helm charts
- `k8s/` - Raw Kubernetes manifests and tools
- `harbor/` - Harbor registry configuration
- `argocd-apps/` - ArgoCD application definitions

# TOOLS
