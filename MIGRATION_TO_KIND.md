## Architecture Comparison

### AWS EKS Pipeline (Before)
```
Developer → GitHub → Jenkins → Maven → SonarQube
                         ↓
                    Docker Build → Harbor
                         ↓
                    Helm Package → ArgoCD → AWS EKS (Cloud)
                         ↓
                    Ansible Configuration
```

### Kind Pipeline (After)
